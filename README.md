PART II – JavaScript & Browsers
Objective
1. Effective use of JavaScript with Browser APIs that manages grid
columns effectively.
2. Create dynamic DataGrid that display / hides column based on
the selected fields from the menu.
Technology
1. Use of JS MVC frameworks is okay; however, try using vanilla
JavaScript to the max. (Bonus+)
2. Use pure CSS. Do not use Bootstrap or Foundation.
3. Organize code by commenting and separating view and logic.
Instructions
1. Create the Data Grid with the JSON. Use of JSON is at your
convenience.
2. Create a dropdown menu with checkboxes.
3. Use JSON as a data provider for the dropdown menu. (You might
have created one in Part I).
4. Position this Dropdown Menu selector at the last column
irrespective of the selection.
5. Restrict the user to select max of 5 columns or the number of
columns that the browser viewport can display without horizontal
scrollbar.
6. On click of the button “Apply”, update the grid with selected
fields, hide the unselected columns. Try adding more data (more
columns) in JSON and evaluate the function.
